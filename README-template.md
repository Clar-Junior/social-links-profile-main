## My process

- Mobile first driven development

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a little more about to adjust responsive screen throught CSS @media queries.

```
@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
        
}
```

Slowly I'm learnign how to document projects.

### Continued development

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React
- Sass
- Bootstrap
